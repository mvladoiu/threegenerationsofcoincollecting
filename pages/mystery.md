# A Family Mystery    
First, a little background on the history of this collection. The coins and banknotes included here came from the personal collections of three people: David Schum (the creator's grandfather), Emily Vladoiu (the creator's mother), and Megan Vladoiu (me, the creator). All three of these collectors were avid travelers, and enjoyed keeping spare coins from the places they visited. There is some fluidity to the collections. Approximately half of the coins in Megan's collection had been given to her by Emily from her own collection years before Megan ever left the United States. It's possible David had given some coins from his collection to Emily.    
However, we knew the story behind the majority of the coins. We assumed that this would be true of the pieces in David's collection as well. Emily is in the possession of a map formerly owned by David; each country he and his wife had visited contained a pin. We thought we would be able to connect the pins and the coins...    
<br>
And then we discovered this:

<br>
Now, to the best of our knowledge, David never visited Cambodia or the Philippines or Peru. There were no pins on the map, and he never talked about going to any of these places. We can be pretty sure he didn't go out of his way to directly purchase them; he was never the type to spend money on something like a coin collection, and many of the coins are not in particularly good condition. So where did they come from? Unfortunately, David passed away in 2021, and we did not come to be in possession of these coins until afterwards. While we will never be able to ask him and get definitive answers, there are several possibilities... 

### Grab Bag
While David wasn't known for buying coins, it is within the realm of possibility that he would purchase some kind of grab bag or mystery box from an auction or antique store. He would have enjoyed the excitement of seeing what small treasures someone else had cast off. Perhaps that's how he came to be in possession of a 10 pfennig coin from the German Empire in 1898.

### Family
Another possibility is that much like his contributions to his daughter's collection, or her contributions to *her* daughter's collection, he was given tokens from his parents' travels. They were the wealthiest family in their town at the time, and are known to have traveled to Cuba. Could they have given him the 1946 centavo?

<br>
### Spy Time?
Could David have been a secret spy at some point in his life? Doubtful, but that doesn't make it less fun to speculate! Perhaps he picked up this one cent coin while snooping on the 1975 general elections in Liberia.

### The Friendliest Man in the World
The most likely answer is that David was an extremely friendly man. He could start a conversation with anyone, and everyone loved to talk to him. He made friends everywhere he went, including a hotel he once worked in. One of his favorite stories to tell was about a real European princess who lived at the hotel while he was working there. They became friendly enough that they kept in touch after he moved on to a different job. It would not be hard to believe that he may have been friendly with people from all over the world, and perhaps they added to his coin collection. Perhaps he was comparing the size of pennies with an equally friendly Australian, and ended up with this 1944 penny hopping in his pocket.
