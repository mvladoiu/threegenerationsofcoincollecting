# A Family Mystery    
First, a little background on the history of this collection. The coins and banknotes included here came from the personal collections of three people: David Schum (the creator's grandfather), Emily Vladoiu (the creator's mother), and Megan Vladoiu (me, the creator). All three of these collectors were avid travelers, and enjoyed keeping spare coins from the places they visited. There is some fluidity to the collections. Approximately half of the coins in Megan's collection had been given to her by Emily from her own collection years before Megan ever left the United States. It's possible David had given some coins from his collection to Emily.    
However, we knew the story behind the majority of the coins. We assumed that this would be true of the pieces in David's collection as well. Emily is in the possession of a map formerly owned by David; each country he and his wife had visited contained a pin. We thought we would be able to connect the pins and the coins...

And then we discovered this:
