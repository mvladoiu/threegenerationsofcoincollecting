# About This Collection
## What's so special about these coins?  
At a surface level, nothing. This is not a collection of particularly rare or highly valued coins and banknotes. They are not ancient, nor are they all "old". They were not purchased from collectors' shops or bid on at auctions. Instead, they are the average, everyday pieces of money that were used by average, everyday people. They were used to purchase food, clothing, gifts. They have changed hands countless times and traveled thousands of miles. Some of them could be spent tomorrow, others haven't held legal value in fifty or even one hundred years.    
Some questions you might explore...   

Can you find a country that created coins in multiple languages to reflect the multiple languages spoken?  
Can you spot colonial powers at work based on any of the curriencies?
Does coin size correlate to value?
