In 1951, six countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands) began the process of forming what would eventually, with the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, become the European Union. Over next seventy years, the partnership grew to include 27 countries: Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom in 1973 (the UK later left in 2020); Greece in 1981;Spain and Portugal in 1986; Austria, Finland, and Sweden in 1995; Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia in 2004; Romania and Bulgaria in 2007; and Croatia in 2013.
