Hi, I'm Megan, the creator of this site. I'm a PhD student in Information Science at Indiana University. I've always had an interest in other countries, starting from the time I was very young. Family members gave me various coins from around the world long before I ever stepped foot outside the United States. Clearly coin collecting is something of a family tradition! The coins and banknotes presented in this digital collection represent only a fraction of their physical collections, selected based on international use laws, condition, and uniqueness. I hope this collection will spark curiousity and interest into the world of international currency!
