# Copyright Statement
As a governmental work, currencies carry copyright status that differ between countries. Besides copyright, reproductions of some currencies are also controlled by counterfeiting law. Due to the complexity of the laws around currency reproductions, this library has made the decision to err on the side of caution and, after consulting with a copyright librarian, decided to follow Creative Commons Licensing interpretations of international laws. Thus, if images of the currency are interpreted as being "Not OK" for inclusion in Wikimedia Commons, they have not been included here.
